# Message attachment

If you want a simple and easy way to use a document during you discussions with an assistant on LibertAI, message
attachments are the way to go!

::: tip Complex use cases
If you want to regularly use the same documents, to create a custom assistant specialized on a topic or have big
documents, [Knowledge bases](knowledge-base.md) will be better suited for you ðŸ˜‰
:::

To pass one or multiple documents into the context of your AI assistant, simply use the button ðŸ“Ž next to the text input
in a conversation:

![Message attachment upload](../../public/assets/chat/documents/message-attachment.png)

Please note that:

- An attachment can be re-used in the whole conversation, not just for the next message from the assistant
- The maximum file size of an attachment is currently capped at 4kB
- The supported file types are listed [here](file-types.md)

::: tip
This size limit will be increased in the future to dynamically adapt based on the model used.\
For the time being, please use a [Knowledge bases](knowledge-base.md) if you need bigger files
