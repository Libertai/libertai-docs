# Chat with documents

LibertAI allows you to upload documents and use them in your discussions with AI assistants.\
Whether it's to summarize a long presentation, provide an example of the output you expect from the AI or simply give
more context and knowledge to the AI about a specific subject, this can be a very useful feature for everyone!

In our [chat interface](https://chat.libertai.io), you have 2 different ways to do this:

- Using a [message attachment](message-attachment.md)
- Using a [Knowledge base](knowledge-base.md)

Feel free to explore both options, in general we recommend the following:

- if you want to ask a one-time question about one/multiple small documents, opt for the simplicity of message
  attachments
- if you have frequent queries about the same subject, want to build a custom assistant that masters a topic, or have a
  lot of big documents, create a knowledge base

The file types supported by these features are the same and can be found [here](file-types.md).
