# Knowledge base

Our [Knowledge base feature](https://chat.libertai.io/#/knowledge-base) is the best way to use your documents for
different use cases within our private AI ecosystem!

::: tip Simple file usage
If you just want to have a simple solution to use one/multiple documents in a single conversion, take a look
at [message attachments](message-attachment.md).
:::

Think of Knowledge bases as a drive where you can create folders and upload documents, and your AI assistant can access
it.

With further improvements and integration of Knowledge bases into our ecosystem, the possibilities and use cases are
endless:

- An AI chatbot in a website FAQ that has access to its content to help users or redirect them to contact you for
  special requests ❓
- A coding assistant that knows every line of your code through an encrypted Knowledge base, updated every
  time you push a change 👩‍💻
- An agent that has access to the recipes of your favorite dishes and can guide you to cook them perfectly 👨‍🍳
- Anything else you can think of 🚀

Knowledge Bases [support various file types](file-types.md) without restriction on the file size (as long as you don't
exceed the limit of your subscription plan)
