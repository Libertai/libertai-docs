# Specifications

Looking for the technologies and models supported by LibertAI agents?\
You're in the right place ðŸ˜Ž

## Models

We provide several open-source models running in decentralized instances with agentic capabilities that can be used in
our framework:

- [Hermes 3 - 8B version](https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B) (fast)
- [Mistral Nemo Instruct 2407](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407) (big context window)

## Python

While LibertAI agents can be run locally with any recent Python version, their decentralized deployment
on [Aleph.im](https://aleph.im) requires specific versions of Python to work in.

We are working closely with the Aleph team to expand this list in the future, especially to support the latest versions:

- 3.11
