# Agents

LibertAI Agents are highly customizable assistants that operates in a decentralized and confidential environment.\
They can be given tools to perform tasks (search something on the web, make a transaction on-chain...), making them
powerful companions.

In addition to tools, the [LibertAI Python framework](https://pypi.org/project/libertai-agents) allows you to choose and
customize:

- A model that fits your needs (check [the list of available models](./specifications))
- The system prompt to give special instructions or restrictions to your agent
- The way to trigger the agent:
    - From an API call (useful if you want to build your own chat UI for example)
    - From Python code (to easily turn it into a Telegram, Discord or X bot)

::: tip
Agents are currently in private beta, contact the team [on Telegram](https://t.me/libertai) if you
want to try it out!\
We are planning some improvements and will listen to beta tester's feedbacks before releasing a stable version.
